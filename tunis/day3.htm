        <p><strong>Day 3 - Saturday September 3, 2005<br />
by Dannette LEININGER, DITC Sports Director          </strong></p>
        <p>Day three of the African Junior Championships began with much anticipation
          since there would be a forum to discuss training possibilities for
          young athletes. There were scheduled presentations by the DeKalb
          International Training Center as well as representation of IAAF Centers in
          Senegal, Egypt, Mauritius, Kenya and Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia,
          as identified training centers for young athletes. Abdel Malek
          El-Hebil, the Senior Manager for the IAAF Member Service Department
          under which Accredited Training Center fall, detailed his plan outlining
          the various training centers such as Regional Training centers, Accredited
          Training Centers and High Performance Training Centers.</p>
        <p>The symposium led off with some fiery challenges by Tunisian president
          General Chetali and was followed by opening statements by African Athletics
          President Colonel Kalkaba. The symposium took a bit of a turn when
          Dr. Marc Daniel Gutekunst of the DITC graciously split his time as a translator
          and presenter. </p>
        <p>Mr. Malek began the symposium by defining the differences of 9 Regional
          Training Centers, 7 High Performance Training Centers and finally Accredited
          Training Centers. Mr. Malek laid out the finances for federations to
          send their athletes to a High Performance Training Center. Every
          system has strengths and weaknesses and coming from a different system
          it seems that the HPC's are underutilized with Dakar having 16 athletes,
          Morocco 5, Mauritius 0 and Kenya 1, for a total of 22 athletes training.
          According to Mr. Malek, these high performance centers receive approximately 1.165 million dollars a year. Which breaks down roughly to $166.4
          thousand per HPC. So between the 4 training they are receiving $665,600
          to train 22 athletes at $30,254 per athlete, which is not unreasonable
          if these athletes were receiving a quality education. Since
          inception HPC athletes have received 4 Olympic Medals: 3 Gold Medals
          and One Bronze. Africa as a continent achieved 23 medals at the 2004
          Olympic Games and similarly, 23 medals were taken at World Championships
          by athletes of Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Uganda, Ghana and Tanzania. </p>
        <p>Atlanta's DITC, as it referred to, was led by Dr. Marc Daniel Gutekunst. The
          presentation began with a very good video outlining the benefits of
          Atlanta's DITC. It was very well received as well as his power
          point presentation, which had to be abbreviated because of the translating
          duties that he had to take over. </p>
        <p>Questions by the 81 or so attendees included one of whether there
          was adequate medical care at the HPC. One comment was
          made by Ahmed Enan, in which he explained a process that was utilized
          for Egyptian Athletes in preparation for the 04 Olympics. Mr.
          Enan explained that it gave the power of choice to the National Olympic
          Committee and ultimately the federation. The "Egyptian Model," provides
          power to choose not only who would receive training but also the power
          to choose the training center they wanted to send their athletes. In
          Egypt's case they sent 2 males in athletics and 1 female in swimming,
          to the DITC. The swimmer ended up participating in the 2004
          Olympic Games, Mr. Enan went on to say the athletes mentioned it was
          the first time they received really professional program and training. </p>
        <p>It is impossible to judge the situation without my American slant
          since I have grown up with a different system and I know there are
          many challenges out there but in my biased opinion there seems to be
          a real opportunity to utilize all the training centers and develop
          a coalition of training centers of sorts in order to increase achievement
          and number of athletes utilizing each center for training, competition
          and educational opportunities available for each nations athletes.
          Standards are supposed to be used to maintain the quality of achievement
          but if there isn't achievement the standards shouldn't be an obstacle
          to utilization of training centers and coaches There are 53 African
          Olympic Committees and there are ample athletes out there that need
          to be identified and systematically trained in order to be the best
          they can be. I agree there is a question of funding but with
          some coordination each center whether it's in Atlanta, Dakar, Nairobi,
          or Cairo just to name a few, each training center can be servicing
          many more athletes with the ultimate goal of allowing each athlete
          reach their potential whether it be through IAAF, Olympic Solidarity
          or alternative means such as the Egyptian Olympic Committee utilizing
          corporate sponsorship.</p>
        <p>There are names like: V&eacute;nuste Niyongabo, Peter Rono, Maria
          Mutola, Mohammed Gammoudi, William Tanui, Amadou Dia Ba, Hichiam El
          Garrouj, Mary Onali, Noureddine Morceli, Francoise Mbango Etone,
          Enefiok Udo Obong, Kenenisa Bekele, Haile Gebreselessis, Glory Alozie,
          Julius Sang, Abdoulaye Seye, Meseret Defar, Ejagaehu Dibaba, John Akii
          Bua, and Kipchoge Keino, to name a few champions. The virtues
          of sport far out way the costs of sport. Can you afford not
          to honor the past by creating a strong future for Africa's athletes to achieve?</p>
