        <p><strong>Day 2 - Friday September 2, 2005<br />
by Dannette LEININGER, DITC Sports Director        </strong></p>
        <p>The second busiest of the meet we witnessed several great performances
          that also include the organizing committee. Day two of the meet
          went of flawlessly and was quite pleasurable to be present. Day
          two we watched athletes perform on the men's side the100m, shot put,
          400 m, Hammer, 1500m, 400m Hurdles capped off by the 10,000. On the
          women's side: 100 m Hurdles, Pole Vault, 100 m, and triple jump. </p>
        <p>South Africa posted top 3 finishes through out the day adding 7 more
          to the already growing number. South Africa's performances are
          scattered through the women's 100m Gold Medal Performance by Thandi
          Mngwevu and Silver Medal by Christine Marike Ras in the 100m Hurdles. The
          South African athletes in the 400m Men's Hurdles, Decathlon and then
          the technical field events of the Shot Put and Men's Hammer all had
          solid results as well. But the Egyptian team scored big Gold
          in the both Men's Hammer and Shot Put. </p>
        <p>The Kenyans and Ethiopians athletes continued to vie for the medals
          in the 1500m and 10,000m. Moses Ndiema Masai set a championship
          record of 23:30.27 in the 10,000 and he went one-two with countryman
          Hosea Mwok Macharinyan. Kenya wasn't the only country to have
          a one-two finish. Sudan's Negmendine Abubaker set the pace in
          the men's 400m with a championship record of 46.08, followed by Al
          Nour Adam of Sudan.</p>
        <p>Day two produces podium visits by both Tunisia and Algeria in a combination
          of Decathlon, the 10,000m Race Walk and on &nbsp; the women's side
          100m the Triple jump and a Gold Medal performance in the Pole Vault
          by Tunisian athlete Nadia Mabrouk. The Senegalese team struck
          gold led by Katim Toure in the Men's 100 m and Seleke Samake in 400m
          Hurdles.</p>
