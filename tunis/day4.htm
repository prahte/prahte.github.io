        <p><strong>The Final Day of the Junior African Athletics Championship-Who
          will take home the crown?<br />
by Dannette LEININGER, DITC Sports Director        </strong></p>
        <p>The final day of the Junior African Athletics Championship was upon
          us all. There will 16 finals today and the championed crowned. On
          day 3, South Africa led in the gold count and overall medals going
          into the last day of competition but with 16 events to be contested
          the out right winner couldn't be predicted. The Women's 10,000m
          Race Walk started the day right and by 9:00 am South Africa stretched
          their lead with Hendrika Botha performance in 52:15.22. Men's
          High Jump began the evening session with a back and forth struggle
          with Botswana's Kabelo Kgosiemang setting a championship record of
          2.16m. Other championship records set by Kenyan athletes in
          the Men's 800m set by Geoffrey Kipkoech and Women's Steeple
          Chase winner Wanjir Mercy Njoroge in the time of 9:50.63. South
          African Marli Knoetze crushed the competition in the discus with a
          throw of 16.93m and Ruan De Vries made it look easy with his championship
          record in the 110 Hurdles with a time of 14.12.</p>
        <p>It seemed like Sudan's national anthem played all night long. Actually
          Sudan took gold to the podium 5 times with and outstanding championship
          performances by Nawel El Jack, winning the 200m, 400m, 400m Hurdles
          and anchored the 4 x 400 relay and her male counterpart Negmedine Abubaker
          nearly mirrored her effort with wins in the 200m 400m and anchor of
          the 4 x 400. It was going to be close but with a strong showing
          South Africa bested the field with Kenya performing solidly and with
          the wild finish in the men's 4 x 400 relay. Siddiq Ahmed Ibrahim raised
          his hand by the second leg of the race because the Sudanese coaches
          had calculated if they were within 20 meters of the leader on this
          leg they would have a good chance to win the race. When Sidiq
          saw that Sudan was only 5 meter behind the leader he knew it was over
          and that Sudan will have won the race and clinched 3 rd in the championships. Sidiq's
          prediction came true and team Sudan took the 4 x 400 in dominating
          fashion by 3 seconds.</p>
        <p>The African Junior Athletics Championship in Tunis ended with spontaneous
          celebration by all the athletes. Of course champions South Africa,
          Kenya and Sudan had something to celebrate as the top 3 finishers in
          the medal count but it was quite refreshing to see all the athletes
          run on to the field with their flags creating a kaleidoscope of color
          just reveling in the moment at the close of a championship. The
          party continued at the closing Athlete Dinner around the poolside of
          the athlete hotel. With dinner was completed; gifts exchanged
          the dancing started led by Murray Sanford and soon the athletes that
          were at their tables changed their clothes and began the pool party.
          It was obvious it was only an activity for the young. So it was
          the signal for yours truly, quoting my father, &quot;To totter off to bed.&quot;</p>
        <p>I've really enjoyed Tunis and I hope to be fortunate enough to return
          in order to experience more about the land and its people as I am certain
          I have only scratched the surface. I am so appreciative to have
          met our host Abdellatif Chekir and experienced Tunisian hospitality,
          and visit some sites such as Carthage, Sidi Bou Said, La Marsa, Old
          Tunis and privileged to be a part of a wonderful championship. I offer
          my congratulations to the Tunisian Athletics Federation for successfully
          hosting the Junior African Athletics Championships. Congratulations
          to all the sports administrators, coaches and competitors that work
          tirelessly to prepare and perform. This championship is a necessary
          stepping-stone to gaining experiences on the international level and
          of course a measuring stick to evaluate the level of performance. Congratulations
          to the top medal count finishers of South Africa, Kenya and Sudan.</p>
