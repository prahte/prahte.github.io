              by &frac12; a cm the B Standards to compete at the 2004 Games, Dr. 
              GUTEKUNST pledged to attend a few event to see our DITC Jump Coach 
              Nat PAGE&#8217;s two other US jumpers perform. </font></p>

              a school teacher in DeKalb County finished at 1.89</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the 28th 
              the finale with was very impressive especially when sitting just 
              across from the high jump pit, when you could see the jumpers and 
              their coaches so well, and read their ever changing emotions. In 
              the end the first US jumper was in 4th position. <br>

              With the success of the Pole Vaulting Clinic with Coach Vitaliy 
              PETROV a day after the 2004 DeKalb Classic, there is a great push 
              to establish a permanent Pole Vaulting Program at the DITC. Dr. 
              GUTEKUNST made sure he attended the finals of Pole Vaulting, to 
              see Timothy MACK from the US at 5.95 take the Gold, followed by 
              Toby STEVENSON from the US at 5.90 win Silver, and finally Coach 
              Vitaliy PETROV&#8217;s athlete Giuseppe GIBILISCO from Italy at 
              5.85 took Bronze. This major accomplishment by the US Team is further 
              encouragement for the DITC to establish a Pole Vaulting Program 
              with the most famous of all Coaches, Vitaliy PETROV who coached 
              Sergiy BUBKA whose world record at 2.14 still stands. At the next 
              Games we hope to see Dominic Johnson (LCA) participate, as well 
              as other athletes who will have gone through the DITC program.</font></p>

              Joseph BATANGDON (CMR) from the Cameroon also trained at the DITC. 
              After finishing second in the 200m final at the 2003 World Indoor 
              Championships he said, &quot;I did not run quite the race I wanted, 
              but I have got a medal so I'm pleased with that.&quot; Joseph was 
              one great athlete at the DITC not only looking out to prepare himself, 
              but always helping his co-athletes. As suggested by the President 
              of the National Olympic Committee of the Cameroon, Joseph could 
              be coming back to the DITC preparing for the 2008 Games. Joseph 
              was attending the Games for the first time and made it to Round 
              2 &#8211; Heat 1, on August 23, 2004 at 20:00 / 8:00 p.m., but did 
              not qualify</font></p>

              are Joseph&#8217;s best performances over the past 3 years:</font><br>

              had spend that evening at synchronized swimming and volley-ball. 
              What a great surprised to see the Nigerian Team qualify in 2nd position 
              behind the US Team.<br>

              Dr. Marc Daniel GUTEKUNST, NOC Guest Pass Credentials would not 
              let him attend the final day of Track &amp; Field, he was not going 
              to miss the excitement of the last day of Track &amp; Field especially 
              when an athlete who had trained at the DITC would run in the final 
              race of the day, and the last one before Man Marathon on the closing 
              day. <br>

              much excitement with the US Team taking the Gold and Silver in Pole 
              Vaulting.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <br>
              By 
              22:25/10:25 p.m the much anticipated 4 x 400 race started. When 
              Enefiok, the fourth and last runner got the baton, the Nigerian 
              Team was in 5th position, and short of a miracle there was no Medal 
              for them. Steadily, the tall Enefiok closed the gap on the pack, 
              he was there in the finish, but how well had he performed. Since 
              Dr. GUTEKUNST was in Section 2 in the second a few yards from the 
              curve, he had to wait to see the results on the screen when he realized 
              that the miracle had happen. He then thought to himself that had 
              the entire Team trained as scheduled in June and July at the DITC 
              under Coach EGBUNIKE, they would certainly have taken as in the 
              2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Dr. GUTEKUNST was immediately on the 
              phone from the stands, and while running to the Olympic Family Section, 
              calling all the key DITC members to share the great news, starting 
              with DITC Co-Founder, Prince Albert of MONACO was on his way to 
              meet Prince Philip of SPAIN, as well as the rest of the DITC Team 
              in Atlanta.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Here 
              were the results for the three top teams:</strong></font><br>

              <span class="style2">Having 
              missed being so close from the finish line in section, Dr. GUTEKUNST 
              sprinted from Section 2 to 29 and enter the Olympic family to attend 
              the Men&#8217;s 4 x 400m Relay Medal Ceremony. Right on time at 
              22:55 the three teams walked in, Enefiok carrying the Nigerian flag, 
              reaching out to the American Team and shaking their hand. While 
              Dr. GUTEKUNST was right above them, he took a series of photos but 
              the flash was not as powerful as expected. These are historical 
              DITC souvenirs.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>At 
              the Closing Ceremonies, 
              Dr. GUTEKUNST</strong>, sitting in the OLYMPIC 
              family section thanks to the tickets given by Mr. Fid&egrave;le 
              WAURA, President of the Olympic Committee of Gabon. In his row to 
              his right was the VP of the Korean Olympic Committee and Mr Rukma 
              Shumsher RANA, President of the Nepal Olympic Committee (NEP), to 
              his right his friend Mr. Robert Zombodze MAGAGULA, President of 
              the Swaziland Olympic &amp; Commonwealth Games Association (SWZ) 
              and his Secretary General Mrs. Muriel HOFER, another friend of Dr. 
              GUTEKUNST Ms. Mirriam MOYO, Secretary General of the National Olympic 
              Committee of Zambia (ZAM), and Mr. Peter UEBERROTH and his wife, 
              President of the US Olympic Committee (USA) with who Dr. GUTEKUNST 
              talked about the DITC and some of the future plans. Mr. UEBERROTH 
              was very encouraging. While the program was festive, and again a 
              first class show the audience in our section was very festive, and 
              when the balloons dropped in we all turned into our childhood. The 
              Chinese performances certainly gave us a sense of the great Games 
              we can expect in Beijing in 2008. What a humbling experience to 
              have participated for the DITC at the Athens Games, certainly the 
              greatest to date. We are looking towards 4 years of preparation 
            taking us to the 2008 Games in Beijing.</span></p>
