            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
              whirlwind trip to the 2004 Olympic Games</strong> was made up of 
              busy hot days and very long cool nights. I love the rhythm of life 
              in Athens. It&#8217;s history, geography, food and people make Athens 
              a beautiful and bustling city. Of the many places I have visited 
              in the world, I will have to return to Athens and Greece as I feel 
              I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface of what the country is all 
              about. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The opportunity to attend 
              the Athens Games was fortuitous and an unexpected pleasure. It was 
              a bit unusual for me as I have been an athlete participating in 
              two Olympic Games but never as a person attending the games. The 
              ability to attend the games came up suddenly and required scrambling 
              for resources to promote DeKalb as a sports destination, recruitment 
              of athletes and to ensure we could properly unveil Steve Allen&#8217;s 
              painting dedicated to the DeKalb International Training Center (DITC) 
              and DeKalb County.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The latter event was 
              graciously hosted at the Visa OLYMPIANS Reunion Center. The Visa 
              OLYMPIANS Reunion Center was an ideal location for Steve Allen&#8217;s 
              unveiling in the presence of DITC Co-Founder Prince Albert of MONACO 
              and Dr. Marc Daniel GUTEKUNST. CEO Vernon JONES as well as many 
              National Olympic Committee representatives and Olympians were present 
              at the unveiling.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              Visa OLYMPIANS Reunion Center was a welcome oasis and I would like 
              to extend my appreciation to Visa and World OLYMPIANS Association 
              (WOA) for creating such a great space. It was an opportunity for 
              Olympians from all over the world to relax, get a bite to eat, watch 
              events and more importantly reunite with other Olympians. I actually 
              ran into some American Olympic wrestlers that I haven&#8217;t seen 
              since the &#8217;92 Games. It was a great rendezvous spot. I really 
              cannot say enough good things about what Visa and the World Olympians 
              Association provided. A special thanks to Dr. Liston BOCHETTE and 
              Rob STULL of WOA for hosting the DITC reception and creating the 
              Visa OLYMPIANS Reunion Center.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              busy days of the Athens games consisted of starting our trek from 
              the United States Olympic Committees Ship the World Renaissance. 
              The USOC kindly extended an invitation to utilize their ship for 
              the DITC staff accommodations. This was a great place for us to 
              stay we enjoyed all the amenities that only the USOC can provide. 
              It allowed us access to Staff and Board members and communications 
              capabilities that made it very convenient to operate. It was time 
              well spent every morning having breakfast with USOC Board of Directors, 
              Staff or National Governing Body Staff. After a very short sleep 
              we would head off the boat to attend meeting after meeting with 
              National Olympic Committee Representatives at the Caravel Divani 
              Hotel. Dr. GUTEKUNST made sure there was a constant flow of strategically 
              selected NOC representatives to discuss DeKalb County and the opportunity 
              the DITC can provide for the athletes of countries of Americas, 
              Caribbean, Africa and Asia. Dr. GUTEKUNST was tirelessly promoting 
              DeKalb as a viable elite athlete-training center. The DITC staff 
              would like to extend our appreciation to the presence of CEO Vernon 
              JONES who really bolstered the DITC credibility with all of the 
              countries and the USOC. I believe the efforts were well spent because 
              we received some very solid commitments from a number of countries 
              to send their athletes to the DITC.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              evenings were filled with attending Olympic events, meetings and 
              dinners at 12:30 a.m. were common place. Both Dr. GUTEKUNST and 
              myself really enjoy track and field and were able to see 200m, 400m, 
              1500m finals one night and finals for the 4 x 100 and 4 x 400 relays 
              on a additional night. We saw the women&#8217;s marathon finish 
              and Dr. GUTEKUNST witnessed his first handball match. The first 
              handball match he watched was a Men&#8217;s match Spain v Germany, 
              double overtime game that was decided in a shootout which is very 
              unusual in handball but was also the deciding factor in the Women&#8217;s 
              Gold Medal Match.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              DITC attendance of the Handball matches were very important in securing 
              a meeting that is another stepping stone to the commitment of USA 
              Team Handball&#8217;s Men&#8217;s Team moving to the DITC. I organized 
              a meeting with President of the International Handball Federation, 
              Dr. Moussa MOUSTAFFA, (EGY) Peter MUHLEMATTER, (SWI) COC, Miguel 
              ROCA, (ESP) Treasurer of IHF, Mauoel OLIVIERA, (BRA) Pan American 
              President, Christophe YAPO ACHY, (CIV) President of Africa, Michael 
              CAVANAUGH, (USA) Executive Director and myself. The main topic of 
              discussion was the future of handball in the United States and how 
              the DITC would like to assist in this process. I believe that Michael 
              CAVANAUGH was pleased to have a platform to speak about the progress 
              of the American handball.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#990000">USA-Africa 
              Track &amp; Field Championships</font></strong><br>
              During the Games we took of advantage of meeting with Dan NGEREM 
              (NGR) President of Nigerian Athletes and Col. Malboum KALKABA (CMR) 
              National Olympic Committee President, President of African Athletic 
              Confederation to discuss the upcoming USA-AFRICA Championships March 
              12 or 13). Mr. NGEREM discussed the proposed dates and strategic 
              planning for fundraising with South African PR firm.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#990000">Steve 
              R. ALLEN presents his gift to the Mayor of Athens</font></strong><br>
              One of the true pleasures of the games was attending Steve Allen&#8217;s 
              presentation to the Mayor of Athens, Dora BAKOYANNIS. In attendance 
              was Congresswoman Diane WATSON, United States Ambassador to Greece, 
              Thomas MILLER, USOC Francisco CCAMPO, and Curt HAMAKAWA, and as 
              it turns out an Athens Council woman that is American Yvette JARVIS. 
              Councilwoman JARVIS is kind of the Madonna of Greece. She is commonly 
              known as &#8220;Yvette&#8221; in Greece where she arrived a number 
              of years ago as a basketball player, model, entertainer and finally 
              seeking public office as a Athens City Councilwoman. <br>
              Allen's latest effort, a 42-by-48-inch painting called, &quot;Unity 
              and Peace Through Sport,&quot; was unveiled at Athens City Hall 
              -- a gift from the people of California, which has twice hosted 
              the summer Olympics, to the city hosting the current Games. Allen 
              has been an official artist of the U.S. Olympic Committee since 
              the 2000, and he is the DITC Official Artist in Residency.<br>
              The painting features the Olympic rings. Five runners represent 
              the five continents of the world bringing the Olympic flame to Athens. 
              The colors of their uniforms are made up only of the colors of the 
              rings. The surface on which they run is comprised of flags of nations 
              that have previously hosted the Olympics. Three women draped in 
              the dresses of ancient Greece represent Athens giving the gift of 
              the Games to the world. A few secrets lie hidden in the painting, 
              such as the bib numbers of four of the runners represent the starting 
              date of previous Games. Well what about the fifth runner with bib 
              number 71054? That stands for July 10, 1954, Steve&#8217;s birthday.<br>
              We received an invitation to join the group for lunch and which 
              resulted in another invitation to New Balance Hospitality, which 
              was hosted at the Yacht Club of Greece. From the Yacht Club we rewarded 
              with a spectacular view of three Olympic venues as well as the coastline 
              and the Olympic sailing competition taking place. Dr. GUTEKUNST 
              received a phone call and we were off and had to cut the visit short 
              to meet the Cheik Talal Fahad Al Ahmad AL-SABAH, National Olympic 
              President of Kuwait.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              2004 Olympic Games were an unbelievable opportunity for the DITC 
              and DeKalb County to promote our site as a sports destination. On 
              a personal note attending the Olympics was a great experience. As 
              an athlete attending the Games I was so focused on my competition 
              I didn&#8217;t get to experience the Games in its entirety. I&#8217;ve 
              gained so much appreciation of the Olympics and the people that 
              give of their lives to make it truly a spectacular human experience.
