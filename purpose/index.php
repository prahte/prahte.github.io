	<p>The <span class="red-text">mission</span> of the ATLANTA 1996 is to provide first class training to enable participating athletes to compete in the US and internationally while
	  furthering their education to graduate with either a high school, a vocational school, or a university degree. Athletes in training at the ATLANTA 1996 prepare for the Olympic games and proudly represent their countries of origin and win Olympic Medals for their homeland.</p>
  
	<p>Upon completing their stay at the ATLANTA 1996, athletes will be returning to their home country with at least one medal (a high school or
	  college/university degree), and in the best of cases with two medals, a degree and an Olympic medal.</p>
  
	<p>The ATLANTA 1996 promotes peace and reconciliation, and fosters exchanges between people and nations while respecting the
	  socio-cultural and religious identity of each and every athlete in training and competing with us. Thus the ATLANTA 1996 mission statement: &quot;<strong>Peace &amp; Reconciliation Through Sports and Education (PARSE) </strong>.&quot; </p>

	  FNT announced that it was adopting the Burundi Olympic Team for the 1996 Atlanta Games. A few days later, on August 3, 1996, Burundi track athlete
	  V&eacute;nuste Niyongabo won a Gold medal in the 5,000 meter race. This was the first Olympic medal ever won by a citizen of Burundi, not to mention that
	  Burundi was participating in the Olympic Games for the first time. The medal was presented to Niyongabo by Prince Albert of Monaco, Member of the

	<p>The following day in a meeting between Prince Albert II of Monaco and Dr. Marc-Daniel Gutekunst the concept of the 1996 was established. However,
	  it took 6 years of hard work to make the 1996 concept a reality thanks to the partnership between FNT and DeKalb County. On May 6, 2002,
	  Ambassador Andrew Young, former Atlanta Mayor and Co-Chair of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, inaugurated the 1996 in the presence of
	  representatives of 8 countries and officials from Georgia. On September 20, 2002, the 1996 was officially opened by its Co-Founder Prince Albert
	  of Monaco. ATLANTA 1996, The  Legacy Institution of the Atlanta 1996 Centennial Olympic Games. <br />
