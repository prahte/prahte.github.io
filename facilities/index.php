	<p>Since 2002, the ATLANTA 1996 village is located at Brook Run.   According to DeKalb County CEO Vernon JONES, Brook Run is &quot;<em>An ideal Home away from  Home</em>&quot; for all the athletes in training and/or in-residency with the  ATLANTA 1996. ATLANTA 1996 main dorm, also know as Cottage 6 (42,000 square feet) provides first class housing, a  cafeteria, a computer lab, a library, an entertainment room, and a work-out room  for all the athletes training with the ATLANTA 1996. In Brook Run, there are over 6  miles of trails in the middle of 70 acres of woods, thus providing the perfect serene and  safe environment for all athletes after a hard day of training.</p>
