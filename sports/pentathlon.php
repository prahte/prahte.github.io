	  The ATLANTA 1996 and Bethany Peace Point Equestrian Foundation, Inc. (BPEF) won in August 2007 the bid to co-host in Atlanta the 2009 Modern Pentathlon World Cup II (March 19-22, 2009). In December 2008, UIPM cancelled the Modern Pentathlon World Cup II. </p>

	<p>BPEF submitted in September 2007 <a href="2007 09 30 BPEF NGB Application to USOC.pdf">a bid</a> (one of 2 submitted) to USOC to become the next US National Governing Body for Modern Pentathlon. Should USOC select BPEF's bid, the ATLANTA 1996 will be part of the next NGB. The ATLANTA 1996 would become a US Regional Training Center for Modern Pentathlon.</p>

	<p>In the above <a href="2007 09 30 BPEF NGB Application to USOC.pdf">BPEF bid document</a> submitted to USOC, the sections pertaining to the ATLANTA 1996 can be found on pages 95-100, 147-148, 150, 163, and 175.</p>

	<p>The Little Creek Horse Farm is the riding site for Modern Pentathlon. The riding and running venues for the 2009 Modern Pentathlon World Cup II were to  be held at Little Creek Horse Farm. DeKalb County purchased in 2004 Little Creek Horse Farm. The farm covers 53 acres and is located at 2057 Lawrenceville Highway in Decatur, Georgia 30033.</p>

	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px; margin-top: 20px; border-top: 1px solid #c4c4c4;">Location TBA: <em>Shooting and Fencing</em></h5>

	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px; margin-top: 20px; border-top: 1px solid #c4c4c4;">Georgia Tech Aquatic Center: <em>Swimming and Track &amp; Field</em></h5>
	
	<p>The Aquatic Center was the site of all swimming, diving and synchronized swimming competition as well as the swimming portion of the modern pentathlon during the Centennial Olympic Games in the summer of 1996. The Aquatic Center provides the ATLANTA 1996 and Georgia Tech with a world-class venue for aquatic sports and serves as an important element of the physical legacy of the Games. The 1,900-seat main stadium contains a competition pool and dive pool.</p>

	</dl>
	
	<p>The competition pool is 50 meters by 10 lanes, with two movable bulkheads so that courses can be set up for 25 yards, 25 meters or 30 meters for water polo. It also features a movable floor which can be set from zero depth to seven feet, eight inches.</p>

	<p>The dive pool features one- and three-meter springboards plus one-, three-, five-, seven and a half- and 10-meter platforms, as well as a Spargar system that sends a mass of bubbles from the bottom of the tank to ease entry into the water.</p>
	
	<p>The original $21 million facility was funded entirely by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG). Construction on the facility began in July 1994 and was completed in time to host the VIIth Synchronized Swimming World Cup in August 1995. The newly-renovated enclosure of the GTAC is part of an over $45 million expansion to the CRC.</p>
	
	<p>There is full ventilation of the facility, including humidity control and air conditioning. The facility has indirect natural sunlight coming through high glass windows on one side.</p>

	<p>The facility includes men's and women's locker rooms, each containing 35 double-width lockers, with a team meeting room situated between the two.</p>
