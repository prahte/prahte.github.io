	<p>Our superior coaching and facilities anchor our track and field program. The ATLANTA 1996 program utilizes the George C. Griffin Track &amp; Field Facility at Georgia Tech.</p>

	<h5>The George C. Griffin Track &amp; Field Facility</h5>
	
	<!--<img src="/images/logo_georgia_tech.jpg" width="187" height="66" alt="Georgia Tech" border="0" class="float-left"/>-->
	<p>The George C. Griffin Track &amp; Field Facility, already considered one of the top sites in the Southeast for outdoor collegiate track
	competition, was recently improved as part of Georgia Tech's preparation for the Centennial Olympic Games.</p>

	</dl>

	<p>Griffin Track was renovated with a state-of-the-art Mondo surface, similar to those used at Olympic Stadium and at the sites of the World
	Championships, USA Track and Field Indoor Championships and NCAA Indoor Championships, and was used as the workout track for the Olympic Village.
	In addition to Griffin Track's state of the art surface and locker rooms, the facility is enhanced by a scenic location which combines natural
	beauty with Atlanta's modern skyline.</p>

	<p>The eight-lane, ultramodern Griffin Track is located between Tech's Rose Bowl practice football fields and the Bill Moore Tennis Center on
	Fowler Street. The grandstands bring the fans close to the action and give them an excellent view of the track as well as the Atlanta skyline.</p>

	<img src="/images/logo_emory.jpg" width="131" height="39" alt="Emory University" border="0" class="float-left"/>
	<p>The George W. Woodruff Physical Education Center opened its doors to the Emory community in August of 1983. The $20 million physical education
	center was named in honor of Mr. George W. Woodruff, a well-known Atlanta engineer, businessman, corporate leader, philanthropist and trustee of
	the University, for his significant role in the transfer of the $105 million Emily and Ernest Woodruff Fund to Emory. The Woodruff Physical
	Education Center is currently going through 12 million dollar renovation project and host basketball courts, indoor running track, pool, weight
	lifting facilities as well as a world class track.</p>
